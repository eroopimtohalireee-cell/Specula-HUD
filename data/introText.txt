Not a virus--trust me
Enjoy the chaos--while it lasts
Built different--barely works
Expectations low--vibes high
Please clap--thank you
Works on my PC--probably
Designed for fun--not balance
Keys may break--good luck
Fingers ready--brain not
Welcome back--again
Loading jokes--please wait
This took effort--some of it
Proceed carefully--or don’t
Loud noises ahead--sorry
Rhythm required--talent optional
Notes included--skill not
Try your best--that’s enough
Powered by music--and stress
Enter at own risk--you were warned
Bugs included--feature complete
Tested by nobody--enjoy
Feel the beat--or miss it
Your timing matters--sometimes
Turn the lights off--vibe time
Headphones recommended--neighbors warned
This is normal--probably
Nothing strange here--yet
Stay hydrated--drink water
Stretch your fingers--seriously
Welcome to funk--population you
Music gets louder--eventually
Press buttons fast--win prizes
Eyes on the notes--not me
Sound check--beep
Beat drops soon--maybe
Get ready--almost
This text is random--or is it
Expect surprises--small ones
Rhythm overload--incoming
Charts may bite--careful
Hands will hurt--worth it
Missed notes happen--cope
You got this--probably
Turn off brain--feel music
Follow the arrows--trust them
Start strong--end stronger
Warm up first--please
Welcome player--unknown
The beat awaits--listen
Fingers on keys--now
Don’t blink--you’ll miss it
Music starts soon--promise
Rhythm engaged--good luck
Play loud--play proud
Enter the groove--slowly
Ready to fail--and retry
Practice makes progress--eventually
The music knows--your timing
Focus up--right now
Start the vibe--immediately
No distractions--almost
Let the beat lead--you
Keep the tempo--steady
Timing test--begin
Arrows incoming--brace yourself
Notes everywhere--have fun
Welcome to the show--front row
Music over everything--always
Feel every note--try
Don’t overthink--tap
Let instincts win--sometimes
Ready when you are--no rush
Enter the rhythm--confidently
This is your moment--kind of
Start the fun--right now
All set--let’s go
Begin the madness--gently

The beat is calling--answer
Get in sync--now
Lights down--music up
Focus your ears--and hands
Press enter--again
Time to play--finally
Rhythm loaded--start
Welcome again--still here
Almost ready--one more
Let’s begin--have fun
Play The--Intro
